# DATA STRUCTURE : Part 2

# A List of Recipes
# Assuming we will need to sort ingredients by amount, write an array (or hash) and object representation of the following data:


# below - 
# first line is always the title 
# second is the number of servings  - appears to be serves 1 word, some # as second word 
# the empty line between the recipe lists would look like ""\n 

# apple salad
# serves 4
# 6 oz mixed greens
# 1 tbs honey mustard
# 2 tbs almonds
# 4 apples -- number, apples - 
# salt and pepper

# bean burgers
# serves 4
# 2 lbs black beans
# 4 buns
# lettuce
# 8 tomatoes, sliced thinly - prep instructions separated by a comma
# 1 cup feta cheese
# mustard

# avocado soup
# serves 2
# 1 avocado
# 1 soup
# cookies
